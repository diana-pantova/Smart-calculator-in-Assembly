# Smart calculator in Assembly
Smart calculator in Assembly, implemented using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)

Designed and implemented a "Smart Calculator" in Assembly language, utilizing Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) for computations. The project focused on understanding and utilizing registers while incorporating a conversion module that converts normal mathematical notation to RPN within the program. Key features of this project include:
* Developing a user-friendly console interface that accepts normal mathematical notation and automatically converts it to RPN for calculations
* Implementing mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using registers in Assembly language
* Efficiently managing stack operations for RPN calculations with register-based optimizations
* Handling user inputs and validating mathematical expressions while seamlessly integrating the conversion module
This project was completed as part of the "Computer Architecture" course, demonstrating proficiency in register-based programming, stack management, and the integration of conversion algorithms in low-level programming environments.
